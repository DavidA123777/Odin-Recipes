    <p>While it’s impossible to beat the classic version — with a homemade ragu and, when I can manage it, homemade pasta — I’m all about an easier version that makes lasagna a much more frequent occurrence. This recipe is exactly that. This lasagna is about as low-lift as you can get while still achieving cheesy, crowd-pleasing results.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar</li>
          <li>marinara sauce (3 cups), such as Rao's or Newman's Own 12 ounces</li>
          <li> low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 3 cups), divided 15</li>
          <li>dry lasagna noodles (not no-boil, about 2/3 of a 1-pound box), divided 15 to 16 ounces</li>
          <li>whole-milk ricotta cheese (about 2 cups), divided</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400°F</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the beef and onion.</strong> Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong> Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce.</strong> Open 1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin layering the lasagna.</strong> Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to create a single layer (it’s OK if the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Continue layering the lasagna.</strong> Arrange 5 more noodles over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that it almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for the end of baking.) Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour. Bake for 1 hour.</strong>Check to make sure the noodles are done by poking the lasagna with a knife; the knife should slide easily through all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking.</strong> Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes.</strong> Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. </li>
        
      </ol>
